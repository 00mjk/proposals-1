### Contributing new proposals

Please see [Contributing to ECMAScript](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the most up-to-date information on contributing proposals to this standard.

### Onboarding existing proposals

Proposals that are Stage 1 and above must be transferred to [the TC39 GitHub organization](https://github.com/tc39) for discoverability and archival purposes. To onboard a proposal that lives outside the TC39 organization:

1. Transfer your repository to the [@tc39-transfer](http://github.com/tc39-transfer) organization
  - if you are a TC39 delegate, but not an admin in that organization, please contact @LJHarb
2. @bterlson will transfer your repository to the TC39 organization the next chance he gets.

Note that as part of the onboarding process your repository name may be normalized. Don't worry, redirects will continue to work.
