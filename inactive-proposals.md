# Inactive Proposals

Inactive proposals are proposals that at one point were presented to the committee but were subsequently abandoned, withdrawn, or rejected.

| Proposal | Champion | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| [Callable class constructors](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/workingdocs/callconstructor.md) | Yehuda Katz and Allen Wirfs-Brock | Withdrawn: can be solved with decorators |
| [Error.isError](https://github.com/ljharb/proposal-is-error) | Jordan Harband | Withdrawn: in favor of a future proposal to standardize Error stack traces |
| [Set/Map.prototype.toJSON](https://github.com/DavidBruant/Map-Set.prototype.toJSON) | David Bruant and Jordan Harband | Rejected: better solved by a custom replacer function. |
| [Typed Objects](https://github.com/dslomov/typed-objects-es7) | Dmitry Lomov, Niko Matsakis | [Abandoned](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/02455e5e2964f62b13818c6fd23289381ecafdf8). |
